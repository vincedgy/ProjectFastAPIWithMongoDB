# MongoDB with FastAPI

This is a small sample project demonstrating how to build an API with [MongoDB](https://developer.mongodb.com/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

It was inspired from this [blog post](https://developer.mongodb.com/quickstart/python-quickstart-fastapi/) - you should go read it!

## TL;DR

If you really don't want to read the [blog post](https://developer.mongodb.com/quickstart/python-quickstart-fastapi/) and want to get up and running,
activate your Python virtualenv, and then run the following from your terminal (edit the `MONGODB_URL` first!):

```bash
# Create and activate python environment 
python -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate

# Install the requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure the location of your MongoDB database:
export MONGODB_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<url>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Start the service:
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You can also use [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc) to get the [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) presentation autogenerated in your browser.
